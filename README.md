 *This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for PA1*

 This notebook demonstrated the codes and functions in creating a Python program

 ### PROBLEM 1: ALPHABET SOUP PROBLEM:
 - A string function returned the phrases "hello" and "hacker" with its letters in an alphabetical ordered though the use of sorting
 - the use of print '(''.join(sorted()))' to make the output more polished
 - The code successfully ran resulting with "ehllo" and "acehkr"

### PROBLEM 2: EMOTICON PROBLEM:
- A string was created that converts the words 'smiley', 'grin', 'sad', and 'mad' into emoticons using .format() function
- All sentences were printed and ran successfully

### PROBLEM 3: UN[ACKING LIST PROBLEM:
- The list 'writeyourcodehere' was separated into three variables, being first, middle, and last, with middle being everything in between the first and last element
- This was done thorugh 'code[0]'
- The code was printed and ran successfully
